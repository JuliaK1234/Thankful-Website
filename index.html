                     I have made a great number of friends this year. I am grateful that I can talk to more people and no longer feel as lonely as before. There are a couple of people I have grown close to. I'm happy that I express myself without having to be as afraid as before.

                     On Thanksgiving break, my cousin visited. Recently, we have been talking more and open up more to each other about our lives. Bond about the hardships of living in our households.

                     Without it, I would have a hard time sleeping. My favorite sleepcasts are from headspace. They include breathing exercises which lower my stress and anxiety. I often listen to the snow and sleeping garden casts.

                        My aunt gifted me a Thanksgiving Cactus which blooms near Thanksgivings and early December. With this being one of the first plants I got to take care, I watered and gave it as much sunlight as I could. Whenever I water it, I take that time to reflect on the good things that has happened to me. Bit by bit, it grew and the flowers started to open. Maybe it's an sign of my own progress.
